## 1. Introduction
Software engineering is a crucial discipline that underpins the development of the software systems essential for our modern world. From simple applications to complex global systems, software engineering involves much more than coding—it encompasses project management, design, maintenance, and ethical considerations. This blog will introduce you to the world of software engineering, its history, the necessity of this field, and the differences between software engineering and computer science. We will also explore what makes good software, the process of professional software development, and the ethical responsibilities that come with being a software engineer.
By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of why software engineering is vital and the various aspects that make it a unique and indispensable field.

## 2. What is Software Engineering ?
- Software engineering is an engineering discipline focused on every aspect of software production, starting from the initial stages of system specification and extending through to the maintenance of the system after it has been deployed. This definition highlights two key aspects:
    - *Engineering discipline* : In the field of engineering, professionals focus on making things work effectively. They apply theories, methods, and tools as appropriate but use them selectively, often seeking innovative solutions even when no established theories or methods are available. Engineers also understand the need to operate within organizational and financial constraints, continuously searching for solutions that fit within these limitations.
    - *every aspect of software production* : Software engineering encompasses more than just the technical processes of software development. It also involves activities such as software project management and the creation of tools, methods, and theories to support the development process.

## 3. History of Software engineering
- In the 1960s, the development of large and complex systems encountered significant difficulties, a situation that came to be known as the "software crisis." To address these challenges, NATO organized conferences in 1968 and 1969, where the term "software engineering" was proposed. The concept suggested that adopting an engineering approach to software development could help reduce costs and produce more reliable software.

## 4. Why We Need Software Engineering ?
- Software engineering is essential for the functioning of government, society, and national and international businesses and institutions. We can’t run the modern world without software. National infrastructures and utilities are controlled by computer-based systems, and most electrical products include a computer and controlling software.

## 5. What is the difference between software engineering and computer science ?
- Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software

## 6. Software Engineering and Software Systems
- Software systems come in a wide variety, from simple embedded systems to complex global information systems. Because different types of software require different approaches, there are no universal notations, methods, or techniques in software engineering.

## 7. What Makes A Good Software ?
- **Acceptability**: Software needs to be acceptable to its intended users, meaning it must be understandable, user-friendly, and compatible with the other systems they use.
- **Dependability and security**: Software dependability encompasses various characteristics, such as reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic harm in the event of a system failure. It must also be secure to prevent malicious users from accessing or damaging the system.
- **Efficiency**: Software should efficiently utilize system resources like memory and processor cycles, avoiding wasteful usage. Therefore, efficiency includes factors such as responsiveness, processing time, and resource utilization.
- **Maintainability**: Software should be designed to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of customers. This capability is crucial, as adapting to change is an inevitable requirement in a dynamic business environment.

## 8. Professional Software development
- Software development is a professional activity where software is created for business purposes, integrated into other devices, or developed as products like information systems and computer-aided design systems. The primary distinctions are that professional software is meant to be used by people other than the developer and is typically created by teams rather than individuals. Moreover, this software is maintained and updated throughout its lifespan.
- Unlike individual programming, software engineering is designed to support professional software development. It encompasses techniques for program specification, design, and evolution, which are typically not applicable to personal software development.

## 9. Software Process
- A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product. Four fundamental activities are common to all software processes:
    1. ***Software specification***, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation
    2. ***Software development***, where the software is designed and programmed.
    3. ***Software validation***, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires
    4. ***Software evolution***, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements
- Different types of systems need different development processes ⚠️

## 10. Software Engineering Ethics
- Similar to other engineering fields, software engineering operates within a social and legal framework that restricts the freedom of its practitioners. As a software engineer, you must recognize that your role extends beyond the application of technical skills. To be respected as a professional engineer, you must also conduct yourself in an ethical and morally responsible manner.
