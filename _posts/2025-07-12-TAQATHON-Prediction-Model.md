## 1.Introduction
Throughout the TAQATHON (TAQA Group × 1337 hackathon), each team was tasked with building a fully AI-powered platform to help TAQA Group predict and classify anomalies in their production units. In addition, the platform had to provide a comprehensive overview of key KPIs to effectively prioritize, manage, and resolve those anomalies.

As the AI lead on my team, my main challenge was to train an ML/DL model capable of accurately predicting and classifying anomalies based on the provided dataset.

At the start, I was faced with several critical questions:
- Which models and algorithms should we use?
- How should we preprocess the data?
- What optimization, training, and testing techniques would yield the best performance?

In this post, I’ll walk you through a detailed, step-by-step breakdown of how I tackled these challenges — and how we delivered a powerful solution that exceeded expectations.
