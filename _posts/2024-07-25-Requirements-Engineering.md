## types
- Natural language requirements
- Modeled requirements

    - Formulas -> mathematical representations
    - code -> pseudocode / early prototype
- Artifact-Based requirements engineering
    - Goals
    - stakeholders
    - constraints

## Process
- Requirements Elicitation
- Requirements Analysis
- Requirements Documentation
- Requirements Verification and validation

## What Could Go Wrong
